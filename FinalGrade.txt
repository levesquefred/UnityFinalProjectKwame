Hey Kwame,

So I think for this FInal project I should get around 90%.  Only thing I did not implement fully was the health system and enemies taking away health.  For some reason from
time to time, I'm able to get my lose condition with the enemy and sometimes not.  I still have trouble understanding OncollisionEnter and they other methods like it.
Anyway, from what I did, I think I hit pretty much all the milestones we covered this semester.  So if it we're me giving my grade, I would give myself a 90-95% for this
final.

Other than that, Merry Christmas and a Happy New year! Thanks for the semester! Hopefully we'll see you again soon!

Fred
